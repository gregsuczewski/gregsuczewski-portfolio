Bootstrap Analysis of Dark Hydrogen Recombination Coefficient
-------------------------------------------------------------

File: interaction_cutoff.ipynb

This notebook performs bootstrap resampling to estimate the mean and 95% confidence intervals 
for dark hydrogen recombination coefficients. The coefficient data files were computed via Monte Carlo 
integration over a truncated power series. The goal of this notebook is to verify convergence 
as a function of the number of terms retained in the power series and to report reliable 95% 
confidence intervals for the converged recombination coefficients.

Input:
- Text files containing recombination coefficient data.

Output:
- Histogram plots of resampled means with 95% confidence intervals.


Simple Linear Regression for Housing Price Predictions
-------------------------------------------------------------

File: real_estate_pricing.ipynb

This notebook demonstrates the application of a simple linear regression model to predict housing prices.
It includes preprocessing steps, such as feature and label transformations, to better capture extreme price
values and enhance model performance. The notebook evaluates the model using RÂ² and visualizes predictions
versus actual prices.

Input:
- Housing dataset in text format (sourced from Kaggle).

Output:
- Performance metrics and visualizations.
